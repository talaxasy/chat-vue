            A collection listing all Achievements available on the GitHub profile.
            <br> <br>
            Following the launch of the first Mars Helicopter, Ingenuity, GitHub announced the new Achievements section:
            <br> <br>
            We are also using this opportunity to introduce a new Achievements section to the GitHub profile. Right now,
            Achievements include the Mars 2020 Helicopter Mission badge, the Arctic Code Vault badge, and a badge for
            sponsoring open source work via GitHub Sponsors.
            <br> <br>
            This repository attempts to list them all.
            <br> <br>
            2022-06-09: GitHub announced more Achievements, but without specific criteria. If you see something not
            listed here, please open an issue :)
